# MAML
A generic Python function that implements a simple version of the "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) Algorithm for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks" as designed by Chelsea Finn et al. 2017 [1]. Especially, this implementation focuses on regression and prediction problems. 

## More about the algorithm
* Chelsea Finn explains well her algorithm in this Standford lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj5SEpFIv8I&list=PLoROMvodv4rNjRoawgt72BBNwL2V7doGI
